## Description

A small and fun incremental game inspired by [Candy Box 2](https://candybox2.github.io/). This project is a personal challenge to improve my vanilla JavaScript skills while creating an engaging and interactive experience.

The Beehive will feature resource collection, upgrades, mini-games, and a save/load system. My goal is to practice core web development concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and localStorage, while also learning how to structure and organize code for a larger project.

This game is designed for fans of idle games or anyone looking for a relaxing and fun experience. If you ended up here, I hope you anjoy this little game and let me know if you have any suggestion or tips.
